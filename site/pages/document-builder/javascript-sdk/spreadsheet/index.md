A spreadsheet document has a more simple structure than that of a text document, most of the spreadsheet elements are nested within the worksheet element with all the other elements placed on it.

The cells can be given various values, some of the cell text properties can also be changed.

The range element can contain areas and comments.

Some drawn objects - images, shapes, charts - can be placed directly to the worksheet.

The text that does not pertain to the cell values, can be grouped to paragraphs and added to the shapes. For the sake of convenience (as it is always easier to work with smaller blocks than with larger ones) the text is usually divided into small text portions called runs. Each paragraph can consist either of only one text run or have dozens of them inside, depending on the paragraph complexity.
