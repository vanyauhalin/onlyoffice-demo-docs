# Overview

ONLYOFFICE Document Builder allows you to build a document easily without the need to actually run a document processing editor. It also allows the developers to automate document building using the templates you create or inserting the data from some database of yours into a document or a set of documents. It has all the features of a common document editor but is lightweight and can be easily integrated into your document management system, CRM system, etc. using its JavaScript API.
